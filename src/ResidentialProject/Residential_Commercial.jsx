                <p> Residential and commercial construction projects both require careful planning, design, and execution, though they differ in scope and purpose. Residential projects focus on creating homes or living spaces, with a priority on comfort, functionality, and personal preferences. Commercial projects, on the other hand, involve larger-scale buildings for business, retail, or industrial use, requiring more complex designs, higher budgets, and adherence to strict regulations. While both types of projects involve site selection, budgeting, structural work, and compliance with building codes, commercial construction typically demands more advanced systems and features due to the nature of the space and its public use.</p>
